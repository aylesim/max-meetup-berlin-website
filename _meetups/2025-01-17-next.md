    In the context of M4L device development, we will discover how interfaces
    impact the creative process, and how sound and design influence each other.

    devices. Aylesim has a deep passion for both creating technological tools as

    questioning its role and impact in society.  With a background in electronic
    music composition and interactive design, Aylesim has presented his work in
    exhibitions, live performances, and workshops, collaborating with
    organizations such as Isotonik Studios and La Scuola Open Source. His
