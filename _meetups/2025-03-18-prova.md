what_to_expect: "We are back with a new appointment titled \"Inside Out Max:
  Connection, Transformation, Sonification\". We wanted to put a stress on data
  types and data processing, which our guests' will address according to three
  different perspectives: sharing data between external platforms and Max,
  transforming sonic data across different techniques, and using data for
  sonification purposes with virtual and physical media. We're excited to
  welcome three speakers to the stage: - Ali Somay, Leslie García, and Bruna
  Guarneri."
