what_to_expect: 'We are back with a new appointment titled "Inside Out Max:
  Connection, Transformation, Sonification". We wanted to put a stress on data
  types and data processing, which our guests'' will address according to three
  different perspectives: sharing data between external platforms and Max,
  transforming sonic data across different techniques, and using data for
  sonification purposes with virtual and physical media. We''re excited to
  welcome three speakers to the stage: - Ali Somay, Leslie García, and Bruna
  Guarneri.'

  activityTitle: All Is Data
  shortdescription:
    The journey of connecting Max with external platforms requires
    speaking a common language. While MIDI is the familiar option, it's merely
    the tip of the iceberg. Through fun live examples, we'll explore numerous
    communication protocols beyond MIDI—establishing shared languages that might
    open unexpected creative pathways.
  name_0: Ali Somay
  picture_0: /assets/Ali Somay.jpg
  bio_0: Ali Somay has been active across multiple disciplines including audio
    engineering, music production, contemporary composition, live performance
    (from solo to traditional bands to electronic music ensembles), hardware
    electronics, software engineering, and professional teaching. His journey
    has included several pivots—abandoning and recreating paths multiple times.
    Having established himself as a software engineer with over a decade of
    experience, Ali has recently found the space to return to his artistic
    practice with the spirit of a 'beginner's mind.' His newest excitement
    centers on Desert Petunia, a solo electronic audio/visual project
    representing his renewed creative output.

  activityTitle: Custom Interfaces & Experimental Sound Design
  shortdescription: Sound creation extends beyond synthesis—it’s about
    transformation. In this talk, we will explore how custom interfaces shape
    experimental sound environments, integrating synthesis, modification, and
    reconstruction. From field recordings to sampling, we’ll dive into
    techniques that redefine sonic textures, bridging digital processes with
    creative sound exploration.
  name_1: Leslie García
  picture_1: /assets/Copia de DSCF0473.jpg
  bio_1: Leslie García (MX) is a sound artist, electronic composer, and creative
    technologist whose work explores the intersections of sound, science, and
    programming. With a background in experimental music and digital media, she
    develops custom interfaces, generative systems, and data-driven compositions
    to expand sonic possibilities. Her practice integrates algorithmic
    processes, bio-inspired sound design, and real-time audio manipulation,
    creating immersive experiences that challenge conventional listening.
    Through her solo project Microhm and collaborations with Interspecifics, she
    bridges electronic composition with technological innovation, crafting new
    forms of sonic expression.
Speaker_2:
  activityTitle: Making Music with Exoplanets
  shortdescription:
    We will explore Max MSP, Jitter, and RNBO patches connected to
    making music with Sensors and Exoplanets, alongside a first look at the
    state of the art of ongoing developments shaping a future 𝕣ꫀᧁꫀꪀꫀ𝕣ꪖ𝕥ⅈꪜꫀ
    ꪑꪊડⅈᥴ community designed for artists, developers, and landscapes.

  bio_2: "𝐵𝓇𝓊𝓃𝒶 𝒢𝓊𝒶𝓇𝓃𝒾𝑒𝓇𝒾 is a Uruguayan artist and luthier based in
    Berlin. She is building Maar.World, a space where music is thought beyond
    binaries, weaving between physical and digital formats, music-making, and
    listening. Her work has shaped sound for the Uruguayan Pavilion at the
    Venice Architecture Biennale (2021, 2018) and the Uruguayan and Chilean
    Pavilion at the Milan Expo 2015. In 2021, she won the AI and Music S+T+ARTS
    Festival Hackathon. She has also been a lead developer in artist-run
    initiatives such as Head Brothers, Exoplanetas and  Aventures Sonores.  "
