what_to_expect: "We are back with a new appointment titled \"Inside Out Max:
  Connection, Transformation, Sonification\". We wanted to put a stress on data
  types and data processing, which our guests' will address according to three
  different perspectives: sharing data between external platforms and Max,
  transforming sonic data across different techniques, and using data for
  sonification purposes with virtual and physical media. We're excited to
  welcome three speakers to the stage: - Ali Somay and Bruna Guarneri."

  activityTitle: All Is Data
  shortdescription: The journey of connecting Max with external platforms requires
    speaking a common language. While MIDI is the familiar option, it's merely
    the tip of the iceberg. Through fun live examples, we'll explore numerous
    communication protocols beyond MIDI—establishing shared languages that might
    open unexpected creative pathways.

  bio_0: Ali Somay has been active across multiple disciplines including audio
    engineering, music production, contemporary composition, live performance
    (from solo to traditional bands to electronic music ensembles), hardware
    electronics, software engineering, and professional teaching. His journey
    has included several pivots—abandoning and recreating paths multiple times.
    Having established himself as a software engineer with over a decade of
    experience, Ali has recently found the space to return to his artistic
    practice with the spirit of a 'beginner's mind.' His newest excitement
    centers on Desert Petunia, a solo electronic audio/visual project
    representing his renewed creative output.
