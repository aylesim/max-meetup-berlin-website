  Hello, fellow maxers!

  June’s sun is shining on Berlin, and we’re celebrating with a relaxed meetup
  before the summer break. Join us at Betahaus Urban (near Hermannplatz) for a
  chill patching jam open to all levels.


  After the jam, we’ll gather for a picnic lunch on the terrace. We’ll provide
  some food, snacks, free coffee and water, plus cold drinks for purchase. Feel
  free to bring your own food and share any dietary needs via the form here:

  Big thanks to everyone supporting this community! 

  Starting with this event, we invite optional donations at the entrance to help
  cover food and support our efforts.


  We can't wait to see you there for a day of creativity, good company, and
  summer patching!
