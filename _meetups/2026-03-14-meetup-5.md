  We are back and what better way to start than with breakfast?

  We'll gather in the morning for a shared breakfast and free patching until lunch.

  Bring a patch or a croissant, any sweet or salty idea in progress, something unresolved, or just curiosity.

  There's no structure, no expectations, no outcome to aim for.
  Just a shared space for listening, making, talking, and spending time together.

  Let's reconnect.
