  activityTitle: "The Dramaturgy of Creative Coding: Storytelling at the
    Intersection of Art and Technology"
  shortdescription: Explore how technology and art converge to create engaging,
    emotionally rich narratives. Marco Accardi offers insights into his creative
    process by showcasing his work with Anecoica Studio. By blending dramaturgy
    with digital media through complex systems built with Max, he highlights how
    creative coding and technology influence both structure and aesthetic
    decisions.

  bio_0: Marco Accardi is a computational artist, independent researcher, and
    software engineer with roots in classical and electronic music. As Head of
    Tech at Anecoica Studio, he helps guide a vision for the future of art that
    merges emotion with innovation, building bridges between human and
    machine-generated creativity. His interdisciplinary journey spans from
    algorithmic sound design to immersive art installations, with works
    exhibited at Ars Electronica, Sónar+D, CTM, and MEET, and research
    collaborations with IRCAM, NOAA, Quantum Basel, and the University of
    Arizona. Operating where science, art, and code converge, Marco’s current
    focus is on crafting systems that transform data from information into
    expression.

  activityTitle: Shipwreck, a tool for navigating a multitude of left-behind sounds
  shortdescription: Olle Holmberg presents Shipwreck, a Max sampler for diving
    into vast sonic oceans, built to explore the wreckage of your praxis. It
    maps hundreds of gigabytes of sound into 128 banks for intuitive, swarm-like
    playback. Inspired by Qu-Bit’s Nebulae, it crossfades between tape loop and
    a new granular mode called Polyplasmic. A hardware version made in RNBO is
    in the works.

    Moon Wheel and Tusagi on labels like Northern Electronics, Herrensauna, Not
    Not Fun, and Where To Now?. He studied live audio-vision under Robin Fox at
    RMIT in Melbourne. His work explores shape-shifting improvisation,
    ecosystems, ritual music, microtonality, field recording, and modular
    synthesis, drawing inspiration from caves, swamps, and altered states. He’s
    held residencies at EMS and AqTushetii, and performed at Berghain, CTM,
    Atonal, Norbergfestival, and Intonal. He hosts The Journey on Berlin
